# Dataset Cleaning and Analysis
In this Notebook I show how to make a quick data cleaning with an exploratory data analysis.

> Note: this was my first project in my path to become a Data Scientist ðŸ˜…

This project is divided into three main sections:
### 1. Data Cleaning
  
Here I added titles to the columns and taken care of the missing values.
  
### 2. Data Summarization
  
In this section I use `.corr` and `groupby()` to create some basic data analysis with tables and graphs. 

### 3. Model Development

Finally, I use Linear Regression to predict the price of a car based on some of the features from the dataset.
